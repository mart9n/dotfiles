    gcloud config set - set a Cloud SDK property

[m[1mSYNOPSIS[m
    [1mgcloud config set[m [4mSECTION[m/[4mPROPERTY[m [4mVALUE[m [[1m--installation[m]
        [[4mGCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...[m]

[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    gcloud config set sets the specified property in your active configuration
    only. A property governs the behavior of a specific aspect of Cloud SDK
    such as the service account to use or the verbosity level of logs. To set
    the property across all configurations, use the [1m--installation[m flag. For
    more information regarding creating and using configurations, see [1mgcloud
    topic configurations[m.

    To view a list of properties currently in use, run [1mgcloud config list[m.

    To unset properties, use [1mgcloud config unset[m.

    Note, Cloud SDK comes with a [1mdefault[m configuration. To create multiple
    configurations, use [1mgcloud config configurations create[m, and [1mgcloud config
    configurations activate[m to switch between them.

[m[1mPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS[m
     [4mSECTION[m/[4mPROPERTY[m
        Property to be set. Note that SECTION/ is optional while referring to
        properties in the core section, i.e., using either [1mcore/project[m or
        [1mproject[m is a valid way of setting a project, while using section names
        is essential for setting specific properties like [1mcompute/region[m.
        Consult the Cloud SDK properties page for a comprehensive list of
        properties: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/properties

     [4mVALUE[m
        Value to be set.

[m[1mFLAGS[m
     [1m--installation[m
        If set, the property is updated for the entire Cloud SDK installation.
        Otherwise, by default, the property is updated only in the currently
        active configuration.

[m[1mGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS[m
    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --billing-project,
    --configuration, --flags-file, --flatten, --format, --help,
    --impersonate-service-account, --log-http, --project, --quiet,
    --trace-token, --user-output-enabled, --verbosity.

    Run [1m$ gcloud help[m for details.

[m[1mAVAILABLE PROPERTIES[m
     [4mcore[m
         [1maccount[m
            Account [1mgcloud[m should use for authentication. Run [1mgcloud auth list[m
            to see your currently available accounts.

         [1mcustom_ca_certs_file[m
            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.

         [1mdefault_regional_backend_service[m
            If True, backend services in [1mgcloud compute backend-services[m will
            be regional by default. Setting the [1m--global[m flag is required for
            global backend services.

         [1mdisable_color[m
            If True, color will not be used when printing messages in the
            terminal.

         [1mdisable_file_logging[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not store logs to a file. This may be useful
            if disk space is limited.

         [1mdisable_prompts[m
            If True, the default answer will be assumed for all user prompts.
            However, for any prompts that require user input, an error will be
            raised. This is equivalent to either using the global [1m--quiet[m flag
            or setting the environment variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m
            to 1. Setting this property is useful when scripting with [1mgcloud[m.

         [1mdisable_usage_reporting[m
            If True, anonymous statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.
            This value is set by default based on your choices during
            installation, but can be changed at any time. For more information,
            see: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics

         [1mlog_http[m
            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the logs. To see logs
            in the terminal, adjust [1mverbosity[m settings. Otherwise, logs are
            available in their respective log files.

         [1mmax_log_days[m
            Maximum number of days to retain log files before deleting. If set
            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and does not delete log
            files. If unset, the default is 30 days.

         [1mpass_credentials_to_gsutil[m
            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK authentication to gsutil.

         [1mproject[m
            Project ID of the Cloud Platform project to operate on by default.
            This can be overridden by using the global [1m--project[m flag.

         [1mshow_structured_logs[m
            Control when JSON-structured log messages for the current verbosity
            level (and above) will be written to standard error. If this
            property is disabled, logs are formatted as [1mtext[m by default.

            Valid values are:
            â–¸ [1mnever[m - Log messages as text
            â–¸ [1malways[m - Always log messages as JSON
            â–¸ [1mlog[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a file
            â–¸ [1mterminal[m - Only log messages as JSON if stderr is a terminal

    If unset, default is [1mnever[m.

         [1mtrace_token[m
            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.

         [1muser_output_enabled[m
            True, by default. If False, messages to the user and command output
            on both standard output and standard error will be suppressed.

         [1mverbosity[m
            Default logging verbosity for [1mgcloud[m commands. This is the
            equivalent of using the global [1m--verbosity[m flag. Supported
            verbosity levels: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, and [1mnone[m.

     [4maccessibility[m
         [1mscreen_reader[m
            Make gcloud more screen reader friendly.

     [4mapp[m
         [1mcloud_build_timeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for Docker builds to complete during
            deployments. All Docker builds now use the Cloud Build API.

         [1mpromote_by_default[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version
            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. This
            property can be overridden via the [1m--promote-by-default[m or
            [1m--no-promote-by-default[m flags.

         [1mstop_previous_version[m
            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, the previously
            deployed version is stopped. If False, older versions must be
            stopped manually.

         [1muse_runtime_builders[m
            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications
            using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of
            client tooling. If not set, the default path for each runtime is
            used.

     [4martifacts[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Default location to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mlocation[m value is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. If this value is
            unset, the default location is [1mglobal[m when [1mlocation[m value is
            optional.

         [1mrepository[m
            Default repository to use when working with Artifact Registry
            resources. When a [1mrepository[m value is required but not provided,
            the command will fall back to this value, if set.

     [4mauth[m
         [1mdisable_credentials[m
            If True, [1mgcloud[m will not attempt to load any credentials or
            authenticate any requests. This is useful when behind a proxy that
            adds authentication to requests.

         [1mimpersonate_service_account[m
            After setting this property, all API requests will be made as the
            given service account instead of the currently selected account.
            This is done without needing to create, download, and activate a
            key for the account. In order to perform operations as the service
            account, your currently selected account must have an IAM role that
            includes the iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the
            service account. The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has
            this permission or you may create a custom role.

     [4mbilling[m
         [1mquota_project[m
            Project that will be charged quota for the operations performed in
            [1mgcloud[m. When unset, the default is [CURRENT_PROJECT]; this will
            charge quota against the currently set project for operations
            performed on it. Additionally, some existing APIs will continue to
            use a shared project for quota by default, when this property is
            unset.

            If you need to operate on one project, but need quota against a
            different project, you can use this property to specify the
            alternate project.

     [4mbuilds[m
         [1mkaniko_cache_ttl[m
            TTL, in hours, of cached layers when using Kaniko. If zero, layer
            caching is disabled.

         [1mtimeout[m
            Timeout, in seconds, to wait for builds to complete. If unset,
            defaults to 10 minutes.

         [1muse_kaniko[m
            If True, kaniko will be used to build images described by a
            Dockerfile, instead of [1mdocker build[m.

     [4mcomponent_manager[m
         [1madditional_repositories[m
            Comma separated list of additional repositories to check for
            components. This property is automatically managed by the [1mgcloud
            components repositories[m commands.

         [1mdisable_update_check[m
            If True, Cloud SDK will not automatically check for updates.

     [4mcomposer[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Composer location to use. Each Composer location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Composer resource URIs being referenced.

     [4mcompute[m
         [1mregion[m
            Default region to use when working with regional Compute Engine
            resources. When a [1m--region[m flag is required but not provided, the
            command will fall back to this value, if set. To see valid choices,
            run [1mgcloud compute regions list[m.

         [1muse_new_list_usable_subnets_api[m

            If True, use application default credentials to authenticate to the
            cluster API server.

         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use the cluster's client certificate to authenticate to
            the cluster API server.

     [4mcontext_aware[m
         [1muse_client_certificate[m
            If True, use client certificate to authorize user device using
            Context-aware access. Some services may not support client
            certificate authorization. If a command sends requests to such
            services, the client certificate will not be validated. Run [1mgcloud
            topic client-certificate[m for list of services supporting this
            feature.

     [4mdataflow[m
         [1mdisable_public_ips[m
            Specifies that Cloud Dataflow workers must not use public IP
            addresses.

     [4mdatafusion[m
         [1mlocation[m
            Datafusion location to use. Each Datafusion location constitutes an
            independent resource namespace constrained to deploying
            environments into Compute Engine regions inside this location. This
            parameter corresponds to the /locations/<location> segment of the
            Datafusion resource URIs being referenced.

     [4mdataproc[m
         [1mregion[m
            Cloud Dataproc region to use. Each Cloud Dataproc region
